This preview is a in-progress first draft of my visual argument image. I chose to do the topic of using reusable bags to reduce plastic use. I imported the two images of the bags from nounproject.com. They are free to use and to modify. I took a logo off the tote bag with the lasso tool and filled it in with transparent so I could put it over text if I wanted to. I also duplicated the plastic bag a bunch of times and eventually figured out how to merge the layers. My screen shot is where I found the merge option. This made it easier because once I arranged the pictures how I wanted, I merged them so now they move as a whole instead of individually. I also added some text. I figured out how to change the colors and font, but I’m not sold on the font yet. It is hard to find fonts in Gimp because they are just in a big list and you can’t really tell what they look like, so it’s going to take a while to find one that I like. I decided to go with green and blue text because it looks clean, and reminds you of the earth. I have not decided if I’m going to keep the background white, but I think it makes the most sense for something like this that would be hung up in a store to catch people’s attention. Also, if it was a flyer, it would take less ink to print a white background. I want to keep the design minimal while also being pleasing to the eye and effective at conveying my argument. So, I think I will have to do some refining.
